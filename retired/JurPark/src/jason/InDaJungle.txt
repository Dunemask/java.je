You come to a wall made of tightly woven trees.
It is about 150 feet tall, and spans as far
as you can see. You see some vines that make 
it possible to climb the trees.

if (You climb the wall){

You start climbing up the vines. Your arms get sore
but the bloodthirsty Tigerasauruses gathered around the base
of the tree keep you motivated. Your stomach starts rumbling
as you spent the last 3 hours climbing the wall of trees.
You smell something sweet.
Looking at a branch next to you, you find
a large plump fruit hanging there.

}
elif (You look for a way around the wall){

You travel for only about 7 steps, and suddenly 
you come across a meadow next to a large pond.
There is a faint glow emanating out of the pond.

if (You go into the meadow){
You prance into the meadow, and find a large
footprint of a T-Rex. You notice that the large rock
right in front of you is not a rock at all. It is a 
Muderdering Marchine.

if(RUN){
}elif(Pet the T-Rex){
}

}elif (You swim into the pond) {
You found a small latch that is connected to an
under-water bunker. 

}
