On the way to the store he saw a %s that was very 
%s. He tried to avert his eyes as to not be rude.
As the dog made his way to the store he got spooked and %s.
The dog wasn't paying attention and hit his head on a %s
The dog began to cry because his head felt very %s and he didn't like it.
The dog's owner %sed over and felt sorry for the dog,

and %sed through the air.
It landed in front of a giant %s  with bats hanging from it.
The dog could see a %s thing hiding inside of it.
The dog began to %s and the owner walked over
They quickly called the %s to cure the situation
When they looked very %s and handeled the situation well
They $sed up the tree and removed what had been hiding inside
The dog had saved the day!
