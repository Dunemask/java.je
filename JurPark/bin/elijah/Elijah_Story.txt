  You begin to look for food. As you walk around you hear a loud roar. In your frantic state you
	begin to run away from the sound. The sound get's quieter and quieter and you stop running.
	A large bush appears in front of you. Your Head says no but your stomache says yes! 	

}
2{
  With your stomache aching for food you begin to think of your mothers home cooking. Her delicious 
	glazed honey hame. The creamy mashed potatoes. Your heart just begins to yearn for the great
	meal. You hear another sound and jump up. A Pteradactyl is hovering over you. Good thing they
	are herbivoires. Suddenly you remember the book you read in kindergarten. They aren't herbivoires.
}
3{
  You run away from the Pteradactyl and bump into a Triceratops' horn and get impailed. 

}
4{
 The Pteradactyl realizes your still alive swoops down and eats you. Devouring your soul along with
	your body
}
5{
	You gasp for breath through your punctured lungs. You can barely breathe as you stumble away 
	The Angry triceratops attax you and you dead.
}
6{
	You decide to give up on life and die!
}
7{
	When you being looking for some wood you hear a screech from a Pteradactyl. You panic and run along
	the beech. You trip over an odd looking rock. You rexamine it and find it to be a dinosaur egg! Lucky you!
	You bring your egg back to your camp and return to your hunt for wood.
}
8{
 The angry Velociraptor Momma comes and eats you because you were gonan eat her kid! You bully!
}
9{
 Because you didn't eat the egg your stomache get's angry and kills you. Your stomache grows arms and legs 
 and eats you from the inside out. 
}
10{
  You drift to sleep with the egg by your side, the mom finds her egg and runs away. You slowly drift away
 and freeze to death from Dinothermia, (The Lack of Dinosaur eggs)
