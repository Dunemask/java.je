 With your stomache aching for food you begin to think 
 of your mothers home cooking. Her delicious 
glazed honey hame. The creamy mashed potatoes. 
Your heart just begins to yearn for the great
meal. You hear another sound and jump up. 
A Pteradactyl is hovering over you. Good thing they
are herbivoires. Suddenly you remember the book 
you read in kindergarten. They aren't herbivoires.
